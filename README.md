# 📌 Nursing Homes Investment in U.S.: Influential Factors and the Impact of COVID-19  
🏆 **Business Analytics Competition | Manhattan College (Feb - May 2024)**  

<br>

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **financial factors influencing investment decisions in U.S. nursing homes**, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. Using **ARIMA and 2SLS models**, my team examined whether investing in nursing homes is financially viable, based on insights from **14,000+ facilities** across various datasets.  

This work was presented at the **Manhattan College Business Analytics Competition 2024**, where my team reached the **semifinals**, presenting findings to **20+ industry experts** and **academic leaders** from institutions such as **Cornell University and New York University**.
