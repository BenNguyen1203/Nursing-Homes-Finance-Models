# 📌 Nursing Homes Investment in U.S.: Influential Factors and the Impact of COVID-19  
🏆 **Business Analytics Competition | Manhattan College (Feb - May 2024)**  

<br>

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **financial factors influencing investment decisions in U.S. nursing homes**, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. Using **ARIMA and 2SLS models**, my team examined whether investing in nursing homes is financially viable, based on insights from **14,000+ facilities** across various datasets.  

This work was presented at the **Manhattan College Business Analytics Competition 2024**, where my team reached the **semifinals**, presenting findings to **20+ industry experts** and **academic leaders** from institutions such as **Cornell University and New York University**.

## 📊 Data & Methodology  

### 📂 Datasets Used  
This project integrates **45+ datasets** covering multiple aspects of nursing home operations, including:  
- **Patient Data** 🏥 – Admissions, discharge, and demographic details  
- **COVID-19 Impact** 🦠 – Infection rates, fatalities, and recovery trends  
- **Quality Ratings** ⭐ – CMS quality scores and regulatory compliance  
- **Provider Information** 🏢 – Facility ownership, type, and staffing levels  
- **Health Deficiencies** 🚑 – Violations, penalties, and compliance history  
- **Vaccination Records** 💉 – Staff and patient vaccination rates  
- **Cost Reports** 💰 – Revenue, expenses, government reimbursements  

### 🛠️ Data Processing & Analysis  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Power BI  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** R (ggplot2, dplyr), Power BI
- **Forecasting & Modeling:**  
  - **ARIMA** (Time Series Forecasting)  
  - **2SLS** (Two-Stage Least Squares for Causal Inference)  

### 📈 Key Findings  
- **Financial Performance Decline**: Many nursing homes experienced a revenue drop post-COVID-19, impacting profitability.  
- **Quality & Investment Correlation**: Higher-quality facilities tend to have more stable revenue streams, making them more attractive to investors.  
- **Government Reimbursements**: Medicare and Medicaid funding significantly influence profitability.  
- **Forecasting Insights**: ARIMA models suggest a **gradual recovery in occupancy rates** but at a **slower-than-expected pace**.
